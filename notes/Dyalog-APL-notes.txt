Dyalog APL notes

Semantics :
All shapes with nonnegative size are significant; that is, define observably different values

Functions:




Operators:

reduce: 
  monadic: for each innermost vector, reduce using given function;
  dyadic: for each innermost vector, map the given function over adjacent (left arg. 1) 
              or fixed-spaced (other than) elements 
scan:
  monadic: ordinary scan 

variant: 
  dyadic: ?



Weird cases:

(1) The presence of 0 in shape vectors

      4 0 ⍴ 1 2 3




      4 0 ⍴ 'abc' 5




      4 0 ⍴ 'abc' 'def'




      +/ 4 0 ⍴ 'abc' 5
 0 0 0  0 0 0  0 0 0  0 0 0 
      +/ 4 0 ⍴ 'abc' 'def'
 0 0 0  0 0 0  0 0 0  0 0 0
